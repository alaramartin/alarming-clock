I made this website using react and nextjs. I love react.

my motivation behind making it was that I already have a different website, but it felt too professional and I was getting bored of it lmao. so I made a weird alarm-themed one.

I used the github and spotify APIs to display my most recent commit (to any repo) as well as my currently playing music. both took a while to figure out ngl, but there are lots of blog posts online from cool programmers that helped
